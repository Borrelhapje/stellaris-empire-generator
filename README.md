# stellaris-empire-generator
This generates 3 random empires to choose from. The web app is hosted at https://stellaris.helderman.xyz/, but feel free to host an instance yourself. If an invalid empire is generated feel free to create an issue.

## TODO
 - on/off toggles for all civics, ethics, authorities, origins and traits
 - toggles for presets such as specific DLC, common MP banned origins and civics, genocidal civics
